<h1>RealTime Pacer</h1>
<p>Slow down a simulation to track real (i.e., wall clock) elapsed time.</p>

<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The RealTime Pacer block slows down ("paces") simulation time to track real elapsed time. The degree of slowdown 
is controllable via the <i>Speedup</i> parameter. To use this block, copy it anywhere in your model (it does not need
to be at the top level).</p>
<p>Some points to keep in mind when using the RealTime Pacer block:</p>
<ol>
    <li> The block relies on slowing down a simulation to make it match real time. If your model involves a lot of 
        computation so that 1 second of simulation time requires more than 1 second of real time, this block will not 
    have any effect. </li>
    <li> The block uses the MATLAB <tt>PAUSE</tt> function to slow down the simulation. The <tt>PAUSE</tt> command gives 
        up the processor during the pause, so system performance does not degrade.</li>
    <li> The matching between simulation time and elapsed real time is approximate, with expected differences on 
        the order of 10 to 30 milliseconds. This limitation is due to difficulties of precise timing with a multitasking 
    operating system. </li>
    <li> The block does not support code generation. </li>
</ol>
The RealTime Pacer block works on all supported Simulink platforms.

<h2>Parameters</h2>
<h3>Speedup</h3>
<i>Speedup</i> specifies the ratio between simulation time and real time. 
<ul>
    <li>Speedup can be any real value greater than zero. A value less than 1 forces the real elapsed time to be greater 
    than the simulation time. For example, with a speedup of 0.5, 1 second of simulation time takes 2 seconds of real time.</li>   
    <li>Speedup = <i>N</i> specifies that <i>N</i> seconds of simulation time correspond to one second of real time</li>
    <li>Speedup = <i>inf</i> specifies that the simulation should run normally, at full speed</li>
</ul>

<h2>Inputs and Outputs</h2>
