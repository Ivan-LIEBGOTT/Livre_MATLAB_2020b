Real-Time Pacer 
October 21, 2010

To use the Real-Time Pacer blocks, do the following:

1) Add the directory containing the Real-Time Pacer blocks and M S-functions 
   to the MATLAB path (these should be in the same directory as this file).

 * Use the ADDPATH command, or
 * Use the Path Tool (In the MATLAB command window, choose File > Set Path ...).

2) Open the Simulink library browser, and look for "Real-Time Pacer" in the
   list of blocksets. 

For an example model that uses these blocks, see realtime_pacer_example.mdl
